AngularJS 1.0.8 (target: 1.2, when stable released) Rails 4
------------

This repository is for learn purpose. It is fine to use generators like angularJS-boilerplate, etc. Although it is nice
to know how all things work behind scenes.

Crucial questions:

* What is the best way to run AngularJS front-end application with Rails back-end ?
* What are downsides of this approach when application logic is getting complex ?

Sideways questions:

* How to secure application <=> both ways (Session Hijacking, XSS) ?
* What is best development flow ?
* How to run application on real production server ? (with configuration details)
* Are there any benefits over standard RoR way ? (programming complexity, application usage, application performance)



Following commands issued so far:

~~~bash
rails new angular_rails -d=mysql -J
